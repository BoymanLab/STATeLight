This macro was written by Karin Seubert, Center for Microscopy and Image Analysis, University of Zurich, karin.seubert@zmb.uzh.ch. It was written using ImageJ 1.53f51
After choosing an import file and output folder, the macro automatically calculates the ratio of acceptor/donor intensity (AoverD) and donor/acceptor intensity (DoverA) and additionally makes the background black for better discrimination of cells versus background in the intensity ratio images. At the end, it saves the AoverD and DoverA images automatically as TIFF files in the specified output folder.
